#+begin_quote
  publish your markdown to dev.to, from cli
#+end_quote

devit is commandline utility that lets you publish your markdown
documents without leaving your comfy terminal.

** Install
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: install
   :END:
You could download the latest release at
[[https://github.com/Mdsp9070/devit/releases][Releases page]]

or install the escript with =mix=

#+begin_example
  mix escript.install hex devit
#+end_example

** Configure
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: configure
   :END:
devit requires dev.to API key to be able to publish your markdown. You
can generate API key from the dev.to
[[https://dev.to/settings/account][settings]] page. Export this
integration token by adding it to your =~/.bashrc=, =~/.zshrc= or
=~/.config/fish/config.fish= as follows

- bash and zsh

#+begin_src sh
  export DEVTO_API_KEY="api_key"
#+end_src

- fish

#+begin_src fish
  set DEVTO_API_KEY "api_key"
#+end_src

Now you are good to go...

** Publishing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: publishing
   :END:
For publishing, your markdown doc must have the following frontmatter:

#+begin_src md
  ---
  title: My Awesome Post
  tags: some, tags, here
  published: true | false
  ---
  ## markdown here
#+end_src

If your post contains images, host them somewhere public and then
include them in your document like so:

#+begin_example
  ![cat](https://catpics.com/some_cat.png)
#+end_example

Dev.to will then CDN it and you can delete it from there if you want to.

When you're ready to publish, run

#+begin_src sh
  $ devit -a <path-to-article>
  Done! Your post has been published at https://dev.to/example/76272e9d241c
#+end_src

It's that simple.

** Uninstall
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: uninstall
   :END:
It's sad to see you go :(

Only remove the downloaded binary

or if you installed via `mix`:

#+begin_example
  mix escript.uninstall devit
#+end_example

** Inspiration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: inspiration
   :END:
This project is completely based on
[[https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/mdm][mdm]]! I really liked of the idea
and tried to implement in Elixir and also give a try on dev.to API!
